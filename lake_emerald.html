          As he roamed California, he stumbled upon this beautiful lake that had
          bright blue with a shade of green along the surface. The water is
          pretty clear to the point you can see the bottom and feel like you'd
          be able to touch it. He felt like he was in a trance as he walked
          along the rocks by the water looking at the mountain and forest
          reflection on the surface. The weather was just right, neither cold
          nor hot, but sunny with a light breeze flowing through the air.
          Looking back and forth between the forest and the lake, he finally
          decides to take a swim in the magical water. When he comes out, it is
          like it has become a new day feeling refreshed and ready for the next
          part of his journey.
